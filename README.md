# NLP GloVe Sentiment Analysis Web App Using Streamlit
## I developed the Sentiment analysis machine learning web app to identify Amazon reviews as positive or negative.
## I used GloVe word embeddings using Spacy library to convert text into vectors which also captures semantic meaning between words.
## I used 3 machine learning classifiers like Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Randrom Forest to predict the results and compared prediction results
## using Classification report. And SVM performed better than other two.
